Class 1: The Stadium Foundation (Layout & Grid)
Goal: Master the Bootstrap grid and navigation structure.

Concepts: CDN Setup, Navbar, Footer, Bootstrap Grid System (container, row, col).

The Build:

Set up index.html with Bootstrap 5.

Create a responsive Sticky Navbar with a brand logo and links (Home, Teams, Match Center).

Build a Hero Section (Jumbotron style) with a background image of a stadium and a "Get Tickets" Call-to-Action button.

Create a footer with social icons.

Homework/Challenge: Customize the Hero section with a gradient overlay using custom CSS.

Class 2: The Highlight Reel (Components & Media)
Goal: Use complex Bootstrap components to display visual content.

Concepts: Carousels, Flexbox utilities, Responsive Images.

The Build:

Highlights Carousel: Implement a Bootstrap Carousel sliding through 3 top "Match Moments" (images/captions).

Upcoming Matches Section: Use the Grid to create 3 placeholders for "Next Match" cards (we will make these dynamic later, but built statically for now to understand the layout).

Video Embed: Embed a YouTube highlight clip using Bootstrap's Ratio helper.

Class 3: The Roster (Dynamic JS & Data Structures)
Goal: Move from static HTML to Dynamic HTML using JavaScript.

Concepts: Arrays of Objects, DOM Manipulation (document.createElement, innerHTML), forEach loops.

The Build:

Create a data.js file. Create an array of objects representing players (e.g., { name: "Leo", team: "Lions", img: "url", stats: 95 }).

The Render Function: Write a JS function that loops through this array.

Dynamic Cards: For each player, generate a Bootstrap Card HTML string and inject it into a #player-container div in the HTML.

Why this is intermediate: Students stop hardcoding HTML and start "rendering" it, a key concept for React/Vue later.

Class 4: Match Day Logic (Interactivity & Modals)
Goal: Add user interaction and event handling.

Concepts: Event Listeners (click), Modals, Conditional Logic.

The Build:

Player Detail Modal: When a user clicks a "View Stats" button on a player card (created in Class 3), open a Bootstrap Modal.

Data Passing: Use JS to populate the Modal with the specific data of the player clicked (Name, Position, detailed bio).

Match Voting System: Create a "Who will win?" section. Add two buttons (Team A vs. Team B). Use JS to increment a counter and update a progress bar to show the live "Fan Prediction" percentages.

Class 5: The "Live" Fan Chat (DOM Simulation)
Goal: Build the "Wow" feature—a real-time chat simulation.

Concepts: Input value handling, setTimeout, Appending children.

The Build:

UI: Build a fixed sidebar or bottom-right chat widget (Scrollable message area, Input field, Send button).

Send Function: When the student types a message and hits enter:

Get the text value.

Create a styled <div> bubble.

Append it to the chat window.

The Bot Simulation: Create an array of random phrases ("What a goal!", "Ref is blind!", "Go Team!").

Automation: Use setInterval or setTimeout to randomly inject these messages into the chat every few seconds, making the site feel "alive" with other fans.

Class 6: Polish & Persistence (LocalStorage & Deploy)
Goal: Professional touches and saving user preferences.

Concepts: LocalStorage API, Dark Mode, Deployment.

The Build:

Dark Mode Toggle: Add a switch in the Navbar. Use JS to toggle a .dark-theme class on the <body>.

Persistence: Save the user's "Dark Mode" preference and their "Vote" from Class 4 to localStorage so it stays after refreshing the page.

Final Polish: Check mobile responsiveness.

Deployment: Upload the project to GitHub Pages or Netlify so they can share the link with friends.
